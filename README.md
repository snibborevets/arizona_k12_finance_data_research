# arizona_k12_finance_data_research

This is a research project looking to understand the link between how K-12 schools and school districts spend money and assessment scores.

The file "generate_metrics_" pulls from a school finance database in csv format and generates/exports metrics and ratios (e.g. % of expenses spent on instruction, student-teacher-ratio).

The file "data_analysis_output_" takes the generated metrics and creates dataframe to perform regression analyses (e.g. simple regression between assessment scores and average teacher salary)

The file "test_23.xlsx" is the raw output of the data_analysis file

The file "tables_for_paper_23.xlsx" is formatted output that pulls from the test_23 file.
